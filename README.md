The D3 library in JavaScript provides an excellent way of producing interactive visualisations which prove particularly useful in data science.
<br><br>
This project looks to train a simple linear regression model using TensorFlow.js, visualising the model's performance throughout this training process, providing code which can be inserted into a webpage to produce an interactive experience.

The deployed version of this project can be observed on my <a href="https://syrekgmr.github.io" target="_blank"/> website </a>
